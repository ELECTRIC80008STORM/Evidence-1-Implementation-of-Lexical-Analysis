"""
Implementation of Lexical Analysis (Automaton and Regular Expression)

This script checks if a word is part of the defined Elven language subset and performs
manual tests by asking the user to input words and checking if they are part of the language.
This is an alternative to the use of regex, instead, the solution is found through the use of
the count() method of lists.
